# PIXIE
Orbital Project by Team Teriri
1. Propose Level of Achievement
Apollo 11
2. Project scope
We aim to deliver a standalone PC application, PIXIE, capable of processing
image inputs initially in normal art forms, to pixel art outputs exhibiting
characteristics of the user image, to assist game developers in creating content for
non-profitable purposes.
Pixie will provide 2 different fully automated modes of conversion to deal with
common usage conditions.
Mode 1 - First Degree Conversion. Under this setting, the generated pixelated
outputs will largely preserve image details. Pixelation will focus on handling the input
imageâ€™s outlines and reducing colour steps, so as to resemble the basic
characteristics of pixel art creations. Technical focuses under this pillar will be the use
of image-processing libraries, particularly to accurately locate character outlines
through the use of colour gradient functions and by merging neighbouring pixels to
increase overall pixel size through image resizing. Considering the good preservation
of details in this conversion, end outputs will be especially useful in pixel game
dialogues and menu presentations.
